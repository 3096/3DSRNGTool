# 3DS RNG Tool

RNG Tool for Pokemon main series game on 3DS platform. Some parts should work with PokeClacNTR using CFW-NTR.

This tool is a complete rewrite based off my SMEncounterRNGTool with largely improved performance and the following features:
- Gen6 RNG, including stationary Pokemon, Mystery Gift Pokemon, Eggs and ID.
- Gen7 stationary, Mystery Gift and wild Pokemon RNG from my SMEncounterRNGTool.
- Gen7 egg RNG and ID RNG based on Quandra's [PokemonSunMoonRNGTool](https://github.com/Quandra/PokemonSunMoonRNGTool) 
- Nidoran line/Volbeat/Illumise gender prediction and shortest accept/reject path solution for Gen7 Egg RNG.
